## lambdata2-drewrust

* This uses TestPyPI to create some utility functions for working with datasets.
* These can be linked to and used in a colab file.
* Lambda School Unit 3 Sprint 1 Module 1 Project.

## Installation

* This program comes with a dataset for soccer match predictions.
* https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/

* There are two classes.

# class Test_Split_Class

### 2 functions:

1.  my_train_val_test_split(df)
2.  example_train_val_test_split(X, y)

# class Others_Class

### 4 functions:

1.  delete_col(column)
2.  find_nulls_func(df)
3.  drop_nulls_cols(df)
4.  convert_to_dates(dateColumn)
5.  enlarge(n)

### Added Working Unittest for delet_col(column) and enlarge(n)

* These Unittest Work!
* They have been tested with different inputs.

### To do:  Add Unit Test for all the other methods.
